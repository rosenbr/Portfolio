Users can update their profile, posted recipes, and comments. While taking the Software Engineering Immersive through General Assembly, I was eating a lot of Instant Noodles to save money. After a few weeks it got repetitive and boring so I would come up with ways to "spice it up" and wanted to a place for others to be able to do the same!</br></br>Noods is currently still in development with plans for more features to be added in the future.

It is very basic and visually not the most appealing, but a few weeks before creating it I could barely write a "for loop." It will always hold a special place in my heart as my first real creation! The inspiration for using a pachycephalosaurus came from the feeling of banging my head against a wall while learning the basics of JavaScript.</br></br>This app has been released with no plans of further updates.

The goal of the project was to reverse-engineer full CRUD functionality from an already existing website. We chose <a href="https://www.yummly.com/">Yummly</a> because we both come from food service backgrounds. This was also the first time working with some within the same repo and different branches on a project.
